Winxed compiler.
Version: 0.Work-in-progress

(C) 2009 Julian Albo

- Stage 0 compiler:

Usage:
	winxedst0 [options] sourcefile

Command line options:

	--target pir	Compile to pir
	--target pbc	Compile to pir, call parrot to compile to pbc
			and delete the pir file.
	-o filename	Use filename for the generated file.
	-c		Compile only. Assume pir if --target is not used.

	-e codfragment	Evaluate. The code fragment provided is compiled
			inside a 'function main(argv) {' ... ';}' enveloppe.
			Useful for one-liners and quick tests.

Default values:

	If -o is not specified, .pir and .pbc extensions are added
	after stripping any extension found.

	If --target is not specified and -c is not used, the source is
	compiled to pir, executed, and the pir file is deleted.

	When using -e the generated files are named '##eval##' with the
	appropiate extension.

NOTE:
	The only supported options from now on are -c and -o.
	All others are now handled by the compiler driver and will be
	dropped from the stage 0 compiler in a near future.

- Compiler driver:

The compiler driver is written in winxed, to compile it you need to build
the stage 0 compiler first. Then you can do the following:

Compile it to pir:
    ./winxedst0 -c winxed.winxed
Build a parrot pbc executable from the pir:
    parrot -o winxed.pbc winxed.pir
Build a native executable from the pbc:
    pbc_to_exe winxed.pbc

Run and insructions: depending on what you've built you can do
    parrot winxed.pir --help
    parrot winxed.pbc --help
    ./winxed --help
